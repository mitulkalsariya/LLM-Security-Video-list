# LLM Security Learning Hub

Welcome to the **LLM Security Learning Hub**! This repository is a curated collection of resources to help learners understand and implement best practices for securing Language Learning Models (LLMs) in real-life applications. By focusing on key principles, such as the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs, this repository aims to make the internet a safer place.
